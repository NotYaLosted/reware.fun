Before you use the script, I want to warn you that **support for the script is over** - 16.02.2025, at the moment we are writing **RECODE** of this script by a small team of developers and testers.

#

This script is **Universal**, which means that it fits all games (at least those without advanced anti-cheat systems).

The script took about 3 days to write, and I - **YaLosted** am pleased to provide you with a fully functioning script on the **Rayfield** library.
